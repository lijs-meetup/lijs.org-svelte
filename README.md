It is deployed to the custom domain [www.lijs.org](https://www.lijs.org) via a Netlify continuous deployment GitHub integration.

Any pushes to the `master` branch automatically run new builds and triggers a new deployment.

The Meetup data is fetched from the Meetup API via a Netlify Lambda function and the contact form is hosted with a Netlify form.

## Usage
You will need to have `node` and `npm` installed on your computer.

**Recommended:**
```sh
git clone git@github.com:lijs-meetup/lijs.org-svelte.git

The Netlify CLI will assign a port and provide the link in the terminal once compiled.
